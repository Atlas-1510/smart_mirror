# Smart Mirror

This mirror shows more than your reflection! It provides a quick overview of the current date and time, weather conditions, and a motivational quote to keep you going.

## Installation

This app provides white text on a black background. Display this on a computer screen, mount a pane of two-way mirror glass on top, and you have a smart mirror!
